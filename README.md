# Nuxt + AI: Giving Your Nuxt App a Voice (and Superpowers)

What if your Nuxt app could talk? Imagine an app that doesn’t just wait for clicks — it chats, understands your data, and even takes action. In this talk, we’ll explore why AI makes sense in your app, when it’s worth adding, and how to set it up without losing your mind. You’ll learn how to connect your app to its own data quickly and easily, turning a regular Nuxt app into one with a voice — and superpowers.
